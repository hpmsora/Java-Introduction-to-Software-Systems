Exercise 1The program compiles, runs, and prints these values representing a and b: 1 1 2 1 3 1 (two at a time). The instance variable a survives successive invocations of instance method fun(…) and becomes 1, 2, 3. Meanwhile b is a local variable, always changing from 0 to 1, then being printed. A has default initial value 0.Exercise 2Compare with the previous exercise: now both a and b are instance variables (initial default values: 0).  As a result they both remember what they were before the instance method fun(...) is called again. Since only one object is involved, the program prints a and b in time: 1 1 2 2 3 3.Exercise 3Compare with previous exercise: now two instances (objects) are involved. So there are two a's (one for alpha and one for beta) and two b's (one for each instance). So you need to keep track what's happening so you know what you're printing:                                        alpha.a       alpha.b       beta.a      beta.b-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------    One alpha = new One();                 0                 0     One beta = new One();                                              0                0     alpha.fun();                           1                 1    beta.fun();                                                        1                1    alpha.fun();                            2                 2The program prints: 1 1 1 1 2 2Exercise 4The output is 1 1 2 2 3 3. Since beta = alpha, beta will keep the alpha’s value. The program initialized both variable as 0 so that the first procedure, alpha.fun();, gave return “1 1 “. Then, since both variable was same value and increased one, the second procedure, beta.fun();, will return “2 2 “. As a same process, the last procedure, alpha.fun();, return “3 3 “. As a result the final return value will be “1 1 2 2 3 3”.Exercise 5The output is 1 1 1 2 2 3. Since the variable b declared as static integer, the variable will keep its value throughout the class so that the alpha.fun(); makes variable a as 1 and b as1 then return “1 1 “. Then the beta.fun(); makes variable a as 1 again due to the alpha and beta are different variable, but the b as 2 due to the b is a static variable which keeps the value from previous procedure. Then the last procedure alpha.fun(); make variable a as 2, and b as 3 due to same reasons. As a result the whole class return “1 1 1 2 2 3”.Exercise 6Exception in thread "main" java.lang.Error: Unresolved compilation problem: 	The constructor One(int) is undefined	at One.main(One.java:7)Compile failure. Since the constructor for One does not accept any variables then One alpha = new One(3) will not compile due to the required parameters were nothing but alpha was given an integer value.Exercise 7The output is 3 0. Since the class One has two constructors which one accepts empty parameter and the other accepts an integer, thus the alpha will be defined as the value as “0” due to empty parameter and the beta will be defined as the value as “3” due to “3” parameter.  Therefore the result will be “3 0”.Exercise 8The output is 3 3. Since the class One has one constructer which accepts only integer value and reserved the value as the input number. But because the variable “value” is a static variable, the value will keep reserved even if the variable is different. The “One alpha = new One(0);” makes the variable value’s value as 0, then “One beta = new One(3);” makes the variable value’s value as 3. Since the alpha and beta represent the variable value as return value, the final result will be “3 3”.Exercise 9The output is 0 0. Since the method “One” does not defined, the variable “value” will be defined as 0 automatically so that the both alpha and beta will return 0. Therefore the final answer will be “0 0”.Exercise 10The output is “ a + b = 1”. Since the variable “a”  and “b” defined as 0 and 1 respectively, the “(a + b)” will be 1 because 0 + 1 is 1. As a result the final answer will be combined with front String value, “ a + b = “, so that it will be “ a + b = 1”.Exercise 11The program does not compile since it is in the file Alpha.java and there is no Alpha. If you change the file name to Gamma then the program will compile and print “Hello” when it runs.
